# Mapping_Earthquakes

  This project's objective was to map earthquakes with varying appearances based on groups of magnitude as well as display the techtonic plates.  The display was to include popup markers for each earthquake. Included are three different map overlays for three display options.  As well as the option to toggle on and off the markers for the earthquakes and techtonic plates for more viewing options.
